               <p>Food is the great unifier that connects us across cultures and generations.
                    We have all had those moments when we smelled something that reminded us of our childhood, or 
                   recreated a dish that we had abroad that immediately brought us back to that foreign place.

                Food can quite literally propel you to another time, another country, another culture without even 
                leaving your dinner table, which is why food culture is such an important way that we as people are able 
                to connect and relate to one another.
                
                As a dual-Italian American citizen, my family’s food culture was something that nourished not only my body 
                but my soul. 
                It was a part of how I connected with my grandparents, it was the lens through which I learned about the environment 
                and where food came from, it was how I bonded with my mom and sisters as I learned how to make homemade marinara sauce
                from the tomatoes my dad grew in our garden. 
                
                My food culture was as much a part of my me as I was a part of my food culture, and as I got older and began 
                traveling the world exploring the food cultures of the world and the way in which they nourish our bodies differently, 
                I began to better understand how my own food culture was able to give me a natural appreciation and sense of connection 
                for the way in which food, local ingredients, and traditions can connect us as people — even when nothing else seems 
                possible.</p>
